The game is quite simple, so simple in fact, that im not going to explain it here.
The starting tutorial explains everything you need to know to play the game.
Below are intructions on how to compile and run the game, good luck adventurer

REPEATED HERE AS SEEN ON CANVAS:
So this project was a disaster from the start, while the end product is just a dev world, otherworlds can be unlocked by changing the region loader code, but nothing in these other worlds work. Trying to build a game in a language I have zero experience in is just a terrible idea for a 'final project'. I planned for a much larger game than was needed and it fell flat. I thought that even with a few extra days this would be enough to complete everything but by the end it became nearly impossible to add to the codebase without something random breaking entirely. I hate java, I could build an entire game like this in python in not even a week. Never given a group, but nor did I want one because if I cant understand the language how am I supposed to understand what my teammates are doing.

With that said I will complete the game by the presentation date, to atleast prove I can do it, even if that means nothing to you or the grade I receive. At this point its about proving to myself its possible while doing this project in a way it was never intended to be done.
And thanks for reading my email asking for an extension, that defiantly made this alot less stressful :/
